            <p>My name is Lauren Guhl, and I'm a third-year CS Major here at Georgia Tech. My threads are Information Internetworks and Intelligence. I'm from Brookhaven, Georgia, not too far from midtown!</p>
            <p>I've loved reading about the work this club does for social good. In high school I worked with a few organizations serving underprivileged children, and I've continued that in college. It's something I'm passionate about, knowing how lucky I am to be receiving a great education.</p>
